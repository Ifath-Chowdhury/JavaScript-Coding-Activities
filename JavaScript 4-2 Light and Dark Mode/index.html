            <h1>SHOCKING: David Zaslav Cancels More Warner Bros Productions</h1>

            <p>
                In a shocking twist that no one could have possibly seen coming, David Zaslav has canceled even more 
                Warner Bros productions. That's right, in a surprising move that could never have been predicted ever, 
                David Zaslav has once again proven why he is the best CEO to ever exist ever. We all know that the Batgirl
                movie and Coyote Vs Acme movie were cancelled, but now David Zaslav has canceled a new Looney Toons IP that 
                wasn't even revealed to the public.
                <br><br>
                When we reached out to David for a comment he had this to say: "At Warner Bros Discovery, we love animation
                and art, which is why it's tough for us to make cuts, but every time we do it we always make way for 
                even greater and more jaw-dropping hit products, like Teen Titans Go."
                <br><br>
                We asked David Zaslav if Warner Bros plans on making any new shows or movies, but he refused to answer and 
                actually kicked us out of the building and told us to never come back.
